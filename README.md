# web3-glossary
A simple, beginner-friendly glossary to understand essential concepts in Web3, Blockchain, DAOs, DeFi, and Smart Contracts.

This repo is part of my journey to build clarity in Web3 writing and documentation.
It is designed to help writers, researchers, and learners grasp core terms and explain them simply.

 ## Why This Exists:
Good writing in Web3 starts with understanding.
This glossary helps me (and hopefully others) balance technical accuracy with simple explanations.

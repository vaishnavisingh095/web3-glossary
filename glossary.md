# 🌐 Web3 Glossary

A simple glossary of common Web3 terms for DAO and blockchain learners.

---

## 🔗 Blockchain
A distributed digital ledger that records transactions across many computers so that records cannot be altered retroactively.

---

## 🧠 Smart Contract
A self-executing piece of code deployed on a blockchain. It automatically performs actions when conditions are met.

---

## ⚡ Layer 2
A secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain to improve scalability and reduce fees.

---

## 🔐 zkEVM
A type of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine that allows for privacy-preserving, scalable transactions.

---

## 💰 Tokenomics
The design of a cryptocurrency's economic system, including supply, distribution, utility, and incentives.

---

## 🗳️ Governance Token
A token that gives holders voting rights in protocol decisions and community proposals.

## 🧭 What is a Block Explorer?
A Block Explorer is like a public search engine for blockchain networks. It lets you track everything happening on a blockchain — in real time.

Think of it like this:

If the blockchain is a digital highway of transactions, a block explorer is your Google Maps.

With a block explorer, you can:

🔍 Search wallet addresses (to view balances & history)

📦 View individual blocks (group of transactions)

🔗 See transaction details (like sender, receiver, gas fee, status)

🧠 Understand what’s happening “under the hood” of a blockchain

💡 Popular Block Explorers:

Etherscan – for Ethereum

Polygonscan – for Polygon

Arbiscan – for Arbitrum

## 🧠 What is Zero Knowledge (ZK)?
Zero Knowledge (or ZK) is a powerful cryptographic method where:

You can prove something is true without revealing any other information.

Imagine this:
You want to prove you’re over 18 without showing your birthdate or ID.
ZK proofs make that possible on the blockchain.

🔐 In Web3, ZK is used to:

✅ Prove identity privately

⚡ Verify transactions fast & securely

🔎 Reduce on-chain data exposure

There are two main uses:

ZK-Rollups: Scale Layer 2 chains (e.g., zkSync, Starknet)

ZK Proofs: Privacy-preserving protocols (e.g., Zcash)

🌀 Zero Knowledge = Privacy + Scalability


## L2 Scaling
Layer 2 (L2) scaling refers to solutions built on top of Ethereum that help it process more transactions faster and cheaper. Examples include Optimism and Arbitrum.

Optimistic Rollups: Assume transactions are correct and only check if someone challenges them.

ZK (Zero-Knowledge) Rollups: Use cryptographic proofs to verify transactions instantly.
